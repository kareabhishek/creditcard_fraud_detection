# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By using historical credit card transaction data, the model will learn to recognize patterns that indicate fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle.

## Requirements

- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Model
We use a combination of data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. The steps include data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).
